# SES Website
Hello SES member!

If you're reading this, I assume you want to contribute to our  website. Firstly, thank you so much, and great to have you onboard! We'll have you up and running in no time :)

### The Workflow
Github (this page) is the git server, and remains the single source of truth. The website is hosted on the Berkeley domain, at `ses@ssh.ocf.berkeley.edu`. However, please DO NOT edit directly on the server (unless you're really confident you know what you're doing). Any change you make to that folder will go live immediately. Therefore, I suggest you work locally:

1. Clone this directory into your local drive
2. Make and test your changes
3. Push to Github (the master branch is fine--We'll make branches later if we get enough people wanting to contribute)
4. SSH into the server (`ses@ssh.ocf.berkeley.edu`)
5. Go to the `~/public_html` folder
6. Pull from Github (the origin is already configured to point here)
7. Go to `ses.berkeley.edu` and admire at the wonder you have just bestowed upon the denizens of the web. 

Now that's a lot of steps. So there's a nice shell script that will do all of that for you, called `publish.sh`. After you have made your changes in the directory, commit your changes with your standard git things. Then, instead of running `git push`, execute this shell script to push and publish your changes (`$ ./publish.sh`).

This script assumes you've already authenticated yourself (aka "remembered your password") in the ocf server. If you haven't, save yourself from a lot of typing now and go here: https://gist.github.com/galacticmonkeys/1b9569d3bf64d6340105

### The File Structure
This is your standard, 1 page, static website with view changes by AngularJS. If you've done this before, you probably don't need to read further. If this is your first time, go forth, my friend.

######The HTML
The landing page, `index.html`, is the page from which everything else is loaded. Each page of the website contains a head, body, and a foot (kind of like people). The head and foot can be found in `templates/`, and the bodies will be in `views/`. As you navigate the website, only the body changes. Therefore, there are substantially more bodies than heads or feet (hopefully not like people). 

######The CSS
CSS is generated using Sass. If you've never played with sass before, here's the lowdown: 

0. Install Sass: http://sass-lang.com/install.
1. The style sheet that's actually requested is called `output/index.css`.  But don't modify this file directly! This is because this file is the complied file, generated by Sass, and the next time someone runs a Sass build, all your changes will be destroyed.
2. The style sheet you should modify is `body.scss`. After you make changes to this, be sure to compile your style sheet by running `sass body.scss:output/index.css`. Yes, you have to compile every time you make changes. If you're going at it with multiple edits, you can use the watch flag: `sass --watch body.scss:output/index.css`. Now, sass will poll for changes and recompile for you whenever it detects a change in `body.scss`
3. In the `partials` folder, you will find the Sass partials for the header, footer, and a nifty bit of css for making iframes responsive. What's a partial? They are modular snippets of css you can inject into another style sheet. `body.scss` already imports all these partials, so  changes to these files will be reflected in `body.scss` which is reflected in `output/index.css` without any special care. 
4. `home.css` only loads on the home page, and is a normal css file. 

######The JS
1. `main.js` contains all your Angular controllers for every view, as well as everything else Angular (services/directives/configs etc)
2. `home.js` is the file for the animations on the home page

### The Rest
All the other folers are simply assets you can add to, use, or ignore.

### The Finally
Look at this dog. See how happy he is!! You know why? Responsive (and responsible) web design with lines and lines of semi-tedious CSS!!!!

Now look at this dog, and see how sad he is :disappointed_relieved: This is what happens if you don't do responsive design.

Don't make the dog sad. Make your CSS responsive :blush:
